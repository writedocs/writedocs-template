The [your-company] API uses the ApiKey security schema to authenticate HTTP requests. API keys are alphanumeric credentials that authorize access to specific features within our API.

## Authentication Headers
Each request must include the following authorization headers:

- `public-api-key:` Your public API key, which can be found in the [your-company]
- `private-secret-key:` Your private secret key, also available in the [your-company] dashboard.
- `X-idempotency-key:` A unique key, up to 64 characters long, to ensure idempotency. 

The following code snippet shows an example of a request including the authentication headers:

```js
curl --request <Method> \
     --url <URL> \
     --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: <Your X-Idempotency-Key>' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --header 'private-secret-key: <Your private-secret-key>' \
     --header 'public-api-key: <Your public-api-key>'
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Keep your keys safe">
Do not share your secret API keys in public places like Github, Bitbucket, etc., because this opens space for malicious API calls.
