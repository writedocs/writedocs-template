WriteDocs CLI allows you to develop your documentation and preview it locally. Our npm package will start a development preview on your localhost.

## Installing the CLI

To install WriteDocs locally, run the following command line:

```
npm i -g writedocs
```

## Using the CLI

To use the CLI commands, you need to navigate to your project's directory on your terminal. WriteDocs CLI needs a `config.json` file, and the needed directories to run properly.

### Available commands

The CLI offers you easy commands to execute the needed tasks:

- `writedocs dev`: Start the WriteDocs development server. Your documentation portal will be available on http://localhost:3000/.

<Callout title="Port Management">
If port 3000 is being used, the CLI handles port conflicts and retries automatically.
</Callout>

- `writedocs api`: Generates endpoint markdown pages from your OpenAPI Specification files.
- `writedocs help`: Display help information, showing available commands and their descriptions.
