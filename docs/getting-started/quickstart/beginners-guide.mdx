Doc-as-code is an approach where documentation is treated like software code. It involves writing, editing, and versioning documentation using the same tools and processes that developers use for coding. This method brings the benefits of collaboration, version control, and automation to documentation, making it easier to maintain high-quality and up-to-date content.

## Doc-as-Code Using GitHub + VS Code
In this guide, you'll learn how to start creating and collaborating on documentation using the doc-as-code approach with GitHub.

### Requirements
Before jumping into this guide, make sure that you have the following requirement checked:
- [x] GitHub account. 
- [x] Completed the steps described on [Quickstart](/quickstart) at least until Step 3. 

### Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a user-friendly application that helps you interact with your GitHub repositories locally. To install GitHub Desktop:

1. Visit the [GitHub Desktop download page](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Download and install the application for your operating system.
3. Once installed, log in with your GitHub credentials.

### Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful and lightweight code editor that's ideal for editing Markdown files. To install VS Code:

1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
2. Download and install the application for your operating system.
3. After installation, open VS Code and install any relevant extensions for Markdown editing (e.g., "MDX" and "MDX Preview").

### Step 3: Clone your documentation project

To start working on the documentation project you created on the [Quickstart](/quickstart), you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click on **File > Clone repository**.
3. Choose documentation you created on the [Quickstart](/quickstart).
4. Select the local path where you want to save the repository and click **Clone**.

### Step 4: Open the project in VS Code

Once the repository is cloned, you can start editing the files:

1. On GitHub Desktop, make sure that the repository showing on the top is your documentation repository. 
2. Click **Open Visual Studio Code** to open VS Code directly with your project. 

### Step 5: Edit the documentation files

Now you're ready to start editing the documentation. Make a test editing an existing page:

1. Navigate to the Markdown file you want to edit in the VS Code Explorer pane.
2. Click on the file to open it in the editor.
3. Make your changes using Markdown syntax.

4. Click **Commit to [branch name]** to commit your changes.
5. Click **Push origin` to push your** changes to the GitHub repository.

## What's Next?
Now that you already know how to edit pages and commit changes to GitHub, we recommend you to follow the sequence below to get the most of WriteDocs:
