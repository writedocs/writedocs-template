## Getting Started
Welcome to the WriteDocs documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to create, deploy, and take your documentation to the highest level with WriteDocs.

### Requirements
WriteDocs uses GitHub to integrate your docs with your code, and make source control effortless. Therefore, make sure you have the following requirements checked before getting started:
- [x] GitHub account
- [x] GitHub organization
- [x] Code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. 

### Step 1: Create a repository from the WriteDocs template on GitHub

Start by creating a new repository in your GitHub organization using the [WriteDocs Template](https://github.com/WriteDocs/WriteDocs-template) provided on GitHub. When creating the repository, use the **`[yourcompanyname]-docs`** standard to define the repository name. This will give you a structured starting point to build your documentation quickly.

### Step 2: Connect your repository to the WriteDocs app

Once your documentation repository is created, follow the steps below to connect the [WriteDocs App](https://github.com/apps/WriteDocs-app) to this repository. This connection ensures that WriteDocs automatically generates and deploys your documentation.
1. Access the [WriteDocs App](https://github.com/apps/WriteDocs-app) on GitHub.
2. Click **Install**.
3. Select **Only select repositories** and look for the documentation repository created in Step 1.

With these simple steps, WriteDocs will automatically deploy your documentation.

### Step 3: Access your documentation

Intially, your documentation will be available at **`[yourcompanyname].docs.writedocs.io`**, using the WriteDocs subdomain.

If you are in the Pro plan, you can add a custom domain to your documentation. For additional information, send and email to integration@writechoice.io and our team will be happy to help you set up your custom domain.

### Step 4: Customize your documentation (config.json)

WriteDocs provides you with a `config.json` file in your documentation repository where you can quickly customize the appearance and structure of your documentation. You can find more information about setting up this file on the [Global Settings](/global-settings) page. 

### Step 5: Update your documentation

When you push changes to the `main` branch, WriteDocs will automatically update and deploy your documentation.
