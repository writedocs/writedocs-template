## Getting Started
Welcome to the WriteDocs documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to create, deploy, and take your documentation to the highest level with WriteDocs.

### Requirements
- [x] GitHub account
- [x] GitHub organization
- [x] Code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. 

### Step 1: Create a repository from the WriteDocs template on GitHub

Start by creating a new repository in your GitHub organization using the [WriteDocs Template](https://github.com/WriteDocs/WriteDocs-template) provided on GitHub. When creating the repository, use the **`[yourcompanyname]-docs`** standard to define the repository name.

### Step 2: Connect your repository to the WriteDocs app

Once your documentation repository is created, follow the steps below to connect the [WriteDocs App](https://github.com/apps/WriteDocs-app) to this repository.
1. Access the [WriteDocs app](https://github.com/apps/WriteDocs-app) on GitHub.
2. Click **Install**.
3. Select **Only select repositories** and look for the documentation repository created in Step 1.

<Callout type="warning" title="Changing your Repository's Name">
WriteDocs don't recommend changing the repository name, but if you need to update it, contact our support at [WriteDocs Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/writedocscommunity/shared_invite/zt-2q61ug34g-wTczth5B_rUThMVbJIyQpg) before updating it, so we can properly configure this update on our side.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Access your documentation

Your documentation will be available at the **`docs.writedocs.io`** domain, similar to the following example:

|Repository name | Documentation URL |
|:--------|:-------|
| `myCompany-docs` | [myCompany.docs.writedocs.io](http://mycompany.docs.writedocs.io/) |


<Callout type="info" title="Custom Domain">
If you are in the Startup or Growth plan, you can add a custom domain to your documentation. For additional information, open a thread at the #support channel in the [WriteDocs Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/writedocscommunity/shared_invite/zt-2q61ug34g-wTczth5B_rUThMVbJIyQpg) and our team will be happy to help you set up your custom domain.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Customize your documentation (config.json)

WriteDocs provides you with a `config.json` file in your documentation repository where you can quickly customize the appearance and structure of your documentation. You can find more information about setting up this file on the [Global Settings](/global-settings) page. 

### Step 5: Update your documentation

When you push changes to the `main` branch, WriteDocs will automatically update and deploy your documentation. However, **we really recommend you to use our [CLI](/local-development) to preview your docs quickly on the local host when you make updates**, and then commit them to GitHub.

<Callout type="info" title="Beginners Guide">
If you don't have much experience in contributing to GitHub projects or using a doc-as-code approach, you can check our [Beginners Guide](/beginners-guide) that covers the basics of working with Git and using a code editor to create docs. 
</Callout>


<Accordion title="Commit status on GitHub">
Whenever a new push is commited to your `main` branch, WriteDocs will keep you informed of the deployment status of your updates. You can keep track of this in your repository's main page.
