API pages enable you to create interactive playgrounds that enhance the developer experience. Developers can send requests and receive responses directly on each endpoint page, streamlining the integration process.

WriteDocs uses OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files to generate endpoint pages, thus ensure you have a valid OpenAPI document in JSON or YAML format that adheres to the [OpenAPI 3.0+ specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).

## Generating Endpoint Pages

To generate API endpoint pages in the API reference tab, you need to follow just a few steps:

### Step 1. Add the OAS file
Add the OAS file to the **reference** folder in your documentation repository on GitHub.

To enhance the visual appeal and user experience of your endpoint pages, you can incorporate any [WriteDocs components](/components) into the endpoint `description` within your OpenAPI specification.
</Callout>

### Step 2. Link the OAS file to the `apiFiles` of your config.json
Specify the path to the OpenAPI file in the `apiFiles` attribute in the **config.json** file of your documentation repo, such as `"apiFiles": ["example.yml"]`. You can add multiple OAS files as needed. 

### Step 3. Use WriteDocs CLI

[WriteDocs CLI](/local-development) can automatically generate the endpoint markdown pages for you. To generate it, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Install WriteDocs CLI globally with `npm i -g writedocs`.
2. Navigate to your projects root directory in your terminal. 
3. Execute the `writedocs api` command line to generate the pages.

Your generated pages can be found at the `docs/reference` folder.

### Step 3. Reference the endpoints in the sidebar of your config.json
Define the paths to each endpoint in the [sidebar object](global-settings/#sidebars) of the **config.json** file following the standard of the example below:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="template" label="Template" default>
    ```json
    "apiReference": [
      {
        "category": "Template",
        "pages": [
          "reference/[OAS-file-name]/[endpoint-operation-id]"
        ]
      }
    ]
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="example" label="Example">
    ```json
    "apiReference": [
      {
        "category": "MANAGE PAYMENTS",
        "pages": [
          "reference/payments/create-payment",
          "reference/payments/retrieve-payment",
          "reference/payments/capture-payment"
        ]
      }
    ]
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

    - `[OAS-file-name]`: The name of the OAS file contained in the **reference** folder. 
    - `[endpoint-operation-id]`: In the OAS file, each endpoint must have an `operationId`. This attribute will be used as the final path of the endpoint slug added to the `apiReference` array. The following code block presents where this parameter is usually locate inside the OAS file. 

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Example API
  description: This is an example API to demonstrate a GET and POST endpoint.
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://api.example.com/v1
paths:
  /items:
    get:
      summary: Get list of items
      operationId: get-items # Attribute you need to reference in the slug.
      description: |
        Retrieves a list of items.
```

### Step 4. Commit the Changes 

Commit your changes to the main branch to see how your endpoint pages look. To see your docs, follow the example below:

|Repository name | Documentation URL |
|:--------|:-------|
| `myCompany-docs` | [myCompany.docs.writedocs.io](http://mycompany.docs.writedocs.io/) |
| `docs-myCompany` | [myCompany.docs.writedocs.io](http://mycompany.docs.writedocs.io/) |
