WriteDocs allows you to create your own React component, and add it to your documentation. This page guides you on how you can create and use your custom components.

## How to Create a Custom Component

To create a usable custom component in WriteDocs, you need to add the component's files to the `components` directory of your documentation repository. The [WriteDocs template](https://github.com/writedocs/writedocs-template) comes with an example `MyCustomComponent` to show you how to do it. 

Just like in React, you can create your components, and add CSS customization, either directly in the component, or with a CSS file. We suggest following the example code and creating a folder for each custom component. In the example, you will see the following structure for the components folder:

```
|-- components
  |-- MyCustomComponent
    |-- MyCustomComponent.jsx
    |-- myCustomComponent.css
```

Remember to import your `css` file into your component's `jsx` file.
</Callout>

## Using your Custom Component

Once your component is created, you can use it in any `mdx` file you need it. You will need only to import it in the file, adding `@site/src/` before the file's relative path. Follow the example below:

```jsx
import MyCustomComponent from '@site/src/components/MyCustomComponent/MyCustomComponent';
```

Now, to use it in your documentation page, you need to call it, just like any other available component in WriteDocs, passing the needed props for it to work:

```jsx
import MyCustomComponent from '@site/src/components/MyCustomComponent/MyCustomComponent';

<MyCustomComponent name="John Doe"/>
```

This will render the following card in your page:

<MyCustomComponent name="John Doe"/>
