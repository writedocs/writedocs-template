In your WriteDocs project, each page is an MDX file. To create MDX pages and display them on the sidebar, follow these steps:

### Step 1. Create an MDX file
Create an MDX file in your docs repository, such as `introduction.mdx`. You can also create folders with multiple MDX files to group related pages into a category.


### Step 2. Set the header configuration
Each MDX file begins with metadata enclosed between triple dashes (---) at the start and end.

```yaml
---
title: Page Configuration
slug: /page-configuration
description: Learn how to make your documentation easy to navigate for users and optimized for search engines.
---
```

#### Attributes 

title <small className="small_tag"><code>string</code></small> <small className="required_tag"><code>required</code></small>
The title that will appear on the page and sidebar. If you want the title on the page to differ from the sidebar, add it as a Heading 1.

slug <small className="small_tag"><code>string</code></small>
The page slug. If this attribute is not specified, WriteDocs will use the MDX page name along with the file path.

description <small className="small_tag"><code>string</code></small>
The page description used for SEO optimization.

### Step 3. Refer the page on the **config.json**
Reference the page in the sidebar object of the **config.json** file. As mentioned in the [Global Settings](global-settings/#sidebar), add the pages within the pages array of strings and/or objects, attaching them to a category inside the sidebarRef name.

```json
"sidebar": { // Define the different sidebars your docs can have (e.g, Guides and API Reference)
    "docs": [ // The sidebarRef name referred in the navbar. Can be changed. 
      {
        "category": "Introduction", // Adds a category to the sidebar
        "pages": [ // The pages in this category
          "introduction/introduction", // The slugs for the pages in this category
          "introduction/quickstart",
          "introduction/global-settings",
          { // An object will add a group of nested pages inside the category
            "page": "introduction/components", // (Optional) Adds a page as the main link of this group of nested pages
            "label": "Components", // Defines the name of the group of nested pages
            "pages": [ // Adds pages to the group of nested pages
              "introduction/components/accordions", 
              "introduction/components/callouts",
              "introduction/components/cards",
              "introduction/components/codeblocks",
              "introduction/components/media"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```
