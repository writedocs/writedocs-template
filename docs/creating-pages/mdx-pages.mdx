slug: /mdx-pages

In your WriteDocs project, each page is an MDX file. To create MDX pages and display them on the sidebar, follow these steps:

### Step 1. Create an MDX file
Create an MDX file in your docs repository, such as `introduction.mdx`. You can also create folders with multiple MDX files to group related pages into a category.


### Step 2. Set the header configuration
Each MDX file begins with metadata enclosed between triple dashes (---) at the start and end.

```yaml
---
title: Page Configuration
slug: /page-configuration
description: Learn how to make your documentation easy to navigate for users and optimized for search engines.
---
```

#### Attributes 

**title** <small className="small_tag"><code>string</code></small> <small className="required_tag"><code>required</code></small>
<br/>The title that will appear on the page and sidebar. If you want the title on the page to differ from the sidebar, add it as a Heading 1.

**slug** <small className="small_tag"><code>string</code></small>
<br/>The page slug. If this attribute is not specified, WriteDocs will use the MDX page name along with the file path.

**description** <small className="small_tag"><code>string</code></small>
<br/>The page description used for SEO optimization.

### Step 3. Refer the page on the **config.json**
Reference the page in the sidebar object of the **config.json** file. As mentioned in the [Global Settings](global-settings/#sidebars), add the pages within the pages array of strings and/or objects, attaching them to a category inside the sidebarRef name.

```json
{
  ...
  "sidebars": [ 
    {
      "sidebarRef": "guides",
      "categories": [
        {
          "categoryName": "Getting Started",
          "pages": [
            "getting-started/overview",
            { 
              "page": "getting-started/quickstart/quickstart",
              "groupName": "Quickstart",
              "subpages": [
                "getting-started/quickstart/beginners-guide"
              ]
            },
            "getting-started/global-settings"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
### Step 4. Commit the changes 
Commit your changes to the main branch to see how your page looks. To see your docs, follow the example below:

|Repository name | Documentation URL |
|:--------|:-------|
| `myCompany-docs` | [myCompany.docs.writedocs.io](http://mycompany.docs.writedocs.io/) |
| `docs-myCompany` | [myCompany.docs.writedocs.io](http://mycompany.docs.writedocs.io/) |
