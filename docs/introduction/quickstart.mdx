To use the WriteDocs solution to create and deploy your documentation portal, follow the steps below:

### Create a Repository from the WriteDocs Template

Start by creating a new repository using the [WriteDocs Template](https://github.com/WriteDocs/WriteDocs-template) provided in GitHub. When creating the repository, use the `<yourcompanyname>-docs` pattern to define the repository name. This will give you a structured foundation to build your documentation.

### Connect Your Repository to the WriteDocs App

Once your repository is created, add the [WriteDocs App](https://github.com/apps/WriteDocs-app) to it. This connection ensures that WriteDocs automatically generates and deploys your documentation.
1. Access the [WriteDocs App](https://github.com/apps/WriteDocs-app) page.
2. Click **Install**.
3. Select **Only select repositories** and look for the repository created in Step 1. **That's all you need to do to have your documentation deployed by WriteDocs**.

### Accessing Your Documentation

Your documentation will be available at **`<yourcompanyname>.docs.WriteDocs.io`**. WriteDocs enables you to customize the documentation domain. For additional information, access the [WriteDocs documentation](https:docs.WriteDocs.io) .

### Updating Your Documentation

When you push changes to the `main` branch, your documentation will automatically update and deploy.

### Configure Your Documentation

To customize the documentation, you will use your repository's `config.json` file. By changing the `config.json` file, you can customize the appearance and structure of your documentation. Access the [WriteDocs documentation](https:docs.WriteDocs.io) for additional information.
